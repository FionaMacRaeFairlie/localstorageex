This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

If you download and clone this example be aware that you need to use npm run dev and then open a browser window and navigate to http://localhost:5173 to view the interface

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
